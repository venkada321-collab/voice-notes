"Fission is Open Source. You can build it from source for free."

The app allows recording of voice through the devices microphone converting it to a transcription and the local llama instance analyses the
transcription and gives a list of tasks allowing the user to quickly use that list to organize their schedules. 

The app is released in google play store and I plan to submit it to FDroid, and iOS as well.
